# Mod 8.3: Create a List and Calculate the Average
- - - - 

## Directions for this Project ##
 
For this program, you're going to ask the user to enter a list of integers. Make sure the user can enter as many integers as they want to. Be sure that the program tells them what index they are entering. 

Find the average of the user entered list and display that average (as a float). Remember that I'll be testing with different sets of numbers!

Hint: the append function will help here!

Make sure your output matches mine:

```
Enter an integer, or "0" to Stop:5
Enter an integer, or "0" to Stop:4
Enter an integer, or "0" to Stop:8
Enter an integer, or "0" to Stop:9
Enter an integer, or "0" to Stop:4
Enter an integer, or "0" to Stop:2
Enter an integer, or "0" to Stop:0
The average of your numbers is 5.333333333333333
