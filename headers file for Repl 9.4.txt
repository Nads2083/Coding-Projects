Dear Friend,

I am Mr. Ben Suleman a custom officer and work as Assistant controller of the Customs and Excise department Of the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs stationed at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Ikeja, Lagos-Nigeria.

After the sudden death of the former Head of state of Nigeria General Sanni Abacha on June 8th 1998 his aides and immediate members of his family were arrested while trying to escape from Nigeria in a Chartered jet to Saudi Arabia with 6 trunk boxes Marked "Diplomatic Baggage". Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197,570,000.00(One Hundred and  Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars).

I declared only (5) five boxes to the government and withheld one (1) in my custody containing the sum of (US$30,000,000.00) Thirty Million United States Dollars Only, which has been disguised to prevent their being discovered during transportation process.Due to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his co-government officials stole from our government treasury amounting
to US$55 Billion Dollars (ref:ngrguardiannews.com) of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one (1)box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as "Precious Stones and Jewellry" in other that its
content will not be discovered. Now that all is calm, we (myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team) are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. 

However as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account
cannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money.

Therefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. We can do this by instructing the Security Company here in Nigeria to
move the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as Precious Stones and Jewelleries" which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment. You will thereafter open an account there and lodge the Money there and gradually instruct remittance to your Country. 

This business is 100% risk free for you so please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality .If you indicate your interest to assist us please just e-mail me for more Explanation on how we plan to execute the transaction.

Expecting your response urgently.

Best regards,

Mr. Ben Suleman

ADDRESS:obong_715@epatra.com  

ATTENTION:PRESIDENT,CEO Sir/ Madam. 

This letter might surprise you because we have met
neither in person nor by correspondence. But I believe
it is one day that you got to know somebody either in
physical or through correspondence. 

I got your contact through discreet inquiry from the
chambers of commerce and industry of your country on
the net, you and your organization were revealed as
being quite astute in private entrepreneurship, one
has no doubt in your ability to handle a financialbusiness transaction. 

However, I am the first son of His Royal
majesty,Obong.D. Eleme , and the traditional Ruler of
Eleme Province in the oil producing area of River
State of Nigeria. I am making this contact to you in
respect of US$60,000,000.00 (Sixty Million United
State Dollars), which I inherited, from my latefather. 

This money was accumulated from royalties paid to my
father as compensation by the oil firms located in our
area as a result of oil presence on our land, which
hamper agriculture, which is our major source oflivelihood. 

Unfortunately my father died from protracted
diabetes.But before his death he called my attention
and informed me that he lodged some funds on a two
boxes with a security firm with an open beneficiary
status. The lodgment security code number was also
revealed to me, he then advised me to look for a
reliable business partner abroad, that will assist me
in investing the money in a lucrative business as a
result of economic instability in Nigeria. So this is
the main reason why I am contacting you for us to move
this money from the security firm to any Country of
your choice for investment purpose. 

So I will like you to be the ultimate beneficiary, so
that the funds can be moved in your name and
particulars to any Country of your choice where it
will be claimed and invested. Hence my father have had
intimated the security firm personnel that the
beneficiary of the box is his foreign partner whose
particulars will be forwarded to the firm when due. 

But I will guide you Accordingly. As soon as the funds
reach, I will then come over to meet you in person, so
that we can discuss physically on investment
potentials. Based on this assistance my Family and I
have unanimously decided to give you 30% of the total
money, 5% for Charity home, 10% for expenses, which
may arise during this transaction, Fax and phone bills
inclusive. The balance of 55% you will invest andmanaged for my Family. 

I hereby guarantee you that this is not government
money, it is not drug money and it is not money from
arms deal. Though you have to maintain high degree of
confidentiality on this matter. I will give more
details about the proceedings of this transaction as
soon as I receive your favorable reply. 

Please reply to my Email Address:obong_715@epatra.com
I hope this will be the beginning of a prosperous
relationship between my family and your family. 

Nevertheless if you are for any reason not interested,
kindly inform me immediately so that I will look foranother contact. 

I am waiting for your quick response. 

Yours faithfully, 

Prince Obong Abbot

Dear sir, 
 
It is with a heart full of hope that I write to seek your help in respect of the context below. I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest (heart attack) while on the seat of power. 
I have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody (for safety) the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. 
This money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit; the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husband's properties is under the authority of the family's lawyer Tony Musa. 
 
My Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husband's wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the "Personal will" of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f!
urther advise,! no relations or fr! 
iends of ours should be used; as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. 
The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this "SOS" call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. 
I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. 
The documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. 
Please, be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody. This is so because any leakage of information could ruin the whole transaction. 
Please all contacts must be made through my lawyer on his email: tony_m@lawyer.com This has to be so as he has been mandated to handle this matter and I have fully briefed him (my Attorney) on my contact to you. Due to my present circumstance, I have handed everything over to him to co - ordinate and finalize with you and I will communicate you as at when necessary. Please for the safety of this transaction, reply stating your phone and fax numbers to enable them contact you directly without running the risk of mail interception. 
I look forward to your quick response. 
Best Wishes, 
Mrs. Maryam Abacha

Request for Urgent Business Relationship 
   
We are Top Officials of the Federal Government of

trapped in Nigeria. 
In order to commence this business we solicit your

subsequent purchase and inventory of the goods to be 
Imported and the investment abroad. 
   
The source of this fund is as follows: During the 
previous military regimes in our country, government 
officials set up companies and awarded themselves 
contracts which were grossly over-invoiced in 
various ministries. The new civilian government now 
setup  a contract review panel which i and my 
colleagues are members and we have identified a lot of 
inflated sum, due to our position  as civil servants 
and members of this panel, we cannot aquire this money 
in our names. 
I have therefore, been delegated as a matter of trust 
by my colleagues of the panel to look for an oversea 
partner into whose account the sum of us$31,000 000,00 
(thirty-one million united states dollars) will be 
Paid by telegraphic transfer. Hence we are writting 
you this letter. 

We have agreed to share the money thus: 
1.  70% for us (the officials) 
2.  20% for the foreign patner(you) 
3.  10% to be used in settling taxation and local and 
Foreign expenses. 

It is this 70% that we wish to commence the 
importation business and the investment abroad. Please 
note that this transaction is 100% safe and we hope 
that the funds can arrive your account in latest 
ten(10) banking days from the date of reciept of the 
following information.A suitable company name and bank 
account(company or personel) into which the funds can 
be paid. 
   
The above information will enable us write letters 
of claim and job  description respectively. This way 
we will use your company's name to apply for payments 
and re-award the contract to your company name. 
   
We are looking foward to doing business with you and 
solicit your confidentiality  in this transaction. 
   
Please acknowledge reciept of this letter using this 
e-mail address. 
davidkuta2002@yahoo.com 
I await your urgent response.

search and found the security Company where I
confirmed that the consignment were deposited for safe
keeping in their securit vault in ghana.

The content were deposited as a family valuable, By
virtue of right as the son of my late father, the
security company has accepted to release the
consignment factually.

his consignment in your name as foreign partner to
claim this consignment. For your assistance,I am ready

CHALLENGE SECURITIES LTD.
LAGOS, NIGERIA



ATTENTION:MADAM/SIR

I am MR.USMAN ABACHA , the Director of Operations
CHALLENGE SECURITIES LTD,LAGOS NIGERIA. Here in
NIGERIA Our firm is a security company of high repute
with years of outstanding service to the people of
Africa.

I have resolved to contact you through this medium
based on business proposal that will be of mutual
benefit to both of us. I got your particulars through
a consultant company base on my research for a
trustworthy and established person that understands
investment ethic for entering into a life time
profitable joint partnership investment and also
co-operation with confidence and trust that you will
keep the contents secret and divulged to any third
party.

To be explicit and straight to the point. Some time
early 1997, a reputable client of ours deposited a
consignment in our company's vault for safe keeping.
And since then our client has failed to come forward
to claim his consignment, which has accumulated a
considerable amount of money in demurrage.

Consequently, in our bide to contact this client to
redeem the demurrage which his consignment had
accumulated we discovered that our client was the
former president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, who
died of illness after he was de-throwed in the same
year the consignment was entrusted into our care.

Since the death of our client President Mobutou
Seseseko, none of his benefactors has come forward to
claim the consignment with us, which means that non of
his relatives or aids had any knowledge of this
consignment. Hence out of curiosity I decided to
secretly open the two boxes that our client deposited
in our vault. And to my surprise I discovered that the
two boxes that were registered as treasurer by our
client actually contained a considerable amount of
money in United States Dollars amounting to about
US$30 million Dollar. Since this development I have
been nursing plans secretly. I also found out from
enquiries and the foreign media that our late client
siphoned a lot of money from his country while he was
in office as head of state.

It is my conviction that the consignment in our vault
was part of the money that our client siphoned and now
that he is dead there is no race to this money in our
care.

I am now soliciting your noble assistance to assist me
in transferring this money out of nigeria to your
country for immediate investment with your assistance.
I have also decided that you will generously be
entitled to 30% of the total amount. Upon my receipt
of your reply confirming your willingness to assist me
of this transaction, I will immediately arrange and
transfer all the rights of ownership of this
consignment to your name to facilitate your easy
clearance and transfer of the complete funds to your
country.

you have nothing to worry about, as I will  be there
to assist you in anyway necessary with all proper
documentation.

This transaction is 100% risk free.

Please maintain absolute confidentiality on this
matter.


Thanks.

Yours faithfully.

MR. USMAN ABDUL

Dear Sir,
 
SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE.
Please Permit me to make your acquaintance in so
informal a manner. This is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust wordy foreign
partner. This request may seem strange and
unsolicited but I will crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. My name is MR TEMI JOHNSON of the Democratic Republic of Congo and One of the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed
memory, may his soul rest in peace.
 
Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to
force out the rebels in my country, I and some of my
colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila
to  go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of
Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel group. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his aide a day before we were schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately  decided to divert the fund into a private security company here in Congo for safe keeping. The security of the said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military Personnel from our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. 
In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary.
WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' to move the fund under Diplomatic Cover to a security company in the europe in your name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it  will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance.
Our inability to move this money out of Congo all
This while lies on our lack of trust on our supposed good friends (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President Kabila, immediately after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other, the information We gathered from an associate
who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance, this transaction will be properly handled with modesty
and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. The said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality.
Thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund out of Congo, you can contact me through my email address above with your telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the modalities and what will be your share

FROM THE DESK OF DR.SAM JORDAN
THE MANAGER
Headquarter,
First Bank of Nigeria Plc.
Lagos, Nigeria.
Alternative E-mail: sam01jordan@yahoo.com
Sir,

Compliment of the day and how is life general with
you? Of course it is my humble wish to solicit and
crave your indulgence to make this project request for
a joint business transaction which I hope will not
come to you as a surprise, hence I plead for
your pardon.

I am Dr.Sam Jordan, the  Manager of headquarter
First Bank of Nigeria Plc. Lagos. I have an urgent and
confidentialbusiness proposal for you. 

On June 6, 1998, an Italian oil
consultant/contractor with via National Petroleum
cooperation (NNPC) Mr. Paul Bush made a numbered time
(fixed) deposit for twelve calenderer month valued at
US$43.7,000.00 in my branch.

On maturity, I sent a routine notification to his
forwarded address but got no reply after months we
send a reminder and finally we discovered from his
contract employee (Nigeria national petroleum
Corporation) that Mr. Paul Bush died from an
automobile accident. On further investigation, it was
clear  that he died without making a will. All
attempts by the Australian to trace his next of
kin were fruitless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered
that Mr. Paul Bush did not declare any next of kin or
relations in all his official documents including his
deposit document in my bank. The total sum
US$43.7,000,000.00 is still in my bank as dormant
acct.
No one will ever come forward to claim it. According
to Nigerian banking law, after five years, the money
will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian
Government. If the account owner is certified death
and nobody comes forward to claim it.

This is the situation , and my proposal is that I am
looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the
beneficiary/next of kin. This is simple. All you have
to do is to immediately send me the details of a bank
account anywhere in the world for me to arrange the
proper money transfer document. The money will then be
transferred into the account for us to share in the
ration of 60% for me 30% for you while the remaining
10% will be set aside for expenses incurred with
here and there.

There is no risk involved. I am using my position and
connection in the bank here to do all the document
work for the transaction. We shall employ the services
of an attorney to draft the will and obtain all
necessary documents and letter of administration in
your fovour for the transfer. This transaction is risk
free guaranteed. If you are interested, please reply
immediately confidentiality and be rest assured that
this transaction could be most profitable for both of
us. Please do not expose this deal if you are not
interested because if you do, it will take me out
of seat.Please expenses is involve in this
business,phone/fax number,and your bank particulars.

I am awaiting your urgent reply.

Best regards,

Dr.Sam Jordan.

/ boxes and labelled as personal belongings and as such
the security company does not know the true content of
the boxes.This money was originally meant to be used
for his political campaign. Because I was his family
Attorney as such he confided in me with the
relevant document papers relating to this deposit
before he died of cardiac arrest.

As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement
with an offshore Security Company to move this money as
a consignment through diplomatic means to their
offshore affiliated office where you will be required
to put claim to the consignment as the bonafide
beneficiary of the consignment. You should know that
this business is safety and 100% risk-free as it
does not involve drug money or Terrorist fund.

From;Mr.Michael Kamah and Family,
          Johannesburg,South Africa.

My Dear ,

Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.

My name is Mr.Michael Kamah, the second son of Mr.Smith  Kamah, of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block an!
d confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.

During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Seven Million and Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$7.400.000.00],in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugab!
e's regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.

Now this is what I actually want you to do for me;

1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.
2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. 

Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.

Best Regards, 

Mr.Michael Kamah and family.

Dear Sir,

A Very Good day to you   

I am Mrs Mariam Abacha. I got your contact from a
close Associate of mine who works with the Nigerian
Chamber of Commerce and Industry  who visited your
country for an International Trade Fair upon my quest
for a trusted and reliable foreign businessman or
company. 
He however gave me the assurance that you can be
trusted to handle a transaction of this magnitude.
Following the sudden death of my husband General Sani
Abacha the late Former Head of State of Nigeria in
1998, I have been thrown into a state of utter
confusion, frustration and hopelessness 
by the present civilian administration, I have been
subjected to physical and psychological torture by the
security agents in the country. 
As a widow that is so traumatized, I have lost
confidence with anybody within the country. You must
have heard over the media reports and the internet on
the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited
by my husband in different security firms abroad, some
companies willingly give up their secrets and
disclosed our money confidently lodged there or many
outright blackmail. In fact the total sum discovered
by
 the Government so far is in the tune of $700. Million
dollars. And they are not relenting to make me poor
for life. I will give you more information  as to this
regard as soon as you reply. I repose great confidence
in you hence my approach to you due to security
network placed on my day to day  affairs I cannot
afford to visit the embassy so that is why I decided
to contact you and I hope you will not betray my
confidence in you. I have deposited  the sum of US$35
million dollars with a security firm abroad whose name
is withheld for now until we open communication. I
shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into
your account for safekeeping. This arrangement is
known to you and my family lawyer who shall deal
directly with you as I am still under house arrest. I
am seriously considering to settle down abroad as soon
as this fund get into your account so that I can start
all over again if only you wish, but if it is
possible, 
just help me in diverting this funds into your bank
account which will accrue you 20% of this fund. Please
honesty is the watchword in this transaction. And
should you accept my terms, kindly send me an email
signifying your interest to my email box as this is
only safe for me now so that we can commence
 communication immediately. And upon receipt of your
message of interest, I shall give you a more detailed

 Let me start by first introducing myself properly to you. I am DR.ANAYO AWKA , a Manager at the Union Bank Nigeria PLC, Lagos. I came to know of you in my private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence. A foreigner, Late Engineer William Adams, an oil Merchant /contractor with the federal Government of Nigeria, until his death three years ago in a ghastly air crash, banked with us here at the Union Bank PLC ,Lagos, and had a closing balance of USD$22.2M (Twenty-Two Million, Two Hundred Thousand United States Dollars)
which the bank now unquestionably expects to be claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or alternatively be donated to a discredited trust fund for arms and ammunition at a military war collage here in Nigeria.

 Fervent valuable efforts are being made by the Union Bank to get in touch with any of late Engr. William Adams's next of kin (he had no known wife and children) that the management under the influence of our chairman, board of directors, Retired Major General Kalu Uke Kalu, that an arrangement for the fund to be declared "UNCLIAMABLE " and then be subsequently donated to the trust fund for Arms and Ammunition, which will further enhance the
course of war in Africa and the world in general. In order to avert this negative development, myself and some of my trusted colleagues in the bank now seek for your permission to have you stand as late Engr.WILLIAMS ADAMSs next of kin so that the fund, USD$22.2M, would be subsequently transferred and paid into your bank account as the

Your share would be 30% of the total amoun!t.! 10% has been set aside for expenses, while the rest would befor myself and my colleagues for purposes in your country.

The Director,



            SEEKING FOR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE 
              (TRANSFER OF US$15.5MILLION)

It is my pleasure to request your assistance on this business proposition which if pursued to its conclusion ,will be of immense benefit to both of us. This request may seem strange but I will crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. My name is Col. Victor Aloma of the Democratic Republic of Congo I am one of close aids to the formal president of Congo Democratic LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may his soul rest in peace.

For the military of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebles in my country, I was instructed by him (late president Kabila) to go to the Europe to purchase ARMS
AND AMMUNIATION worth us$15.5(fifteen million Five Hundred Thousand us Dollars) to fight the reble groups. But when it became ap! parent  that president
Kabila has been killed in a bloody shoot out by one of his aids. I immediately decided to divert the fund ( US$15.5) into  a private security company for safe
keeping. The money is presently in Holland (The Netherlands) where I am currently in exile  after the death of president Kabila.

I need a reliable and trust worthy foreign partner/national who can assist me to clear and move this money as the beneficiary from the security company.

Though we have not seen nor met each other, but I would want this transaction to be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two weeks, this money in question is state fund as it is a deal between you and I, hence the need for secrecy considering the security implications.


Thus, if you are willing to assist me to move this fund out of the Netherlands, you can contact  me onthe above email addres to enable us discuss more about the deal and what  your percentage will be for assisting me.

Please note that you will be required to make a brief trip to the Netherlands for inspection of the fund. I also intend to visit your country soonest in order to inquire areas of possible business investment.

I shall be sincerely glad if my request is rendered.

Kindest  Regards,

COL. Victor Aloma

DEAR RESPECTFUL,
I BEG TO SOLICIT FOR YOUR URGENT AND MAXIMUM
ASSISTANCE

THIS MAIL, I KNOW THIS MAIL MAY EMBARRASS YOU OR SURPRISE YOU BY EMBARRASSMENT, I MEAN COMING FROM SOMEBODY YOU NEVER KNOW OR MET BEFORE, EVEN COMING FROM A COUNTRY PERHAPS YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW (GHANA) NOTED FOR DISHONEST AND FRUADULET PRACTICES. WELL, THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE SCAM LETTERS FROM (GHANA OR OTHER AFRICAN COUNTRIES, BUT FROM A FAMILY OF WHO ARE IN DISTRESS AND REQUIRE YOUR ASSISTANCE.LET ME START BY INTRODUCING MYSELF PROPERLY TO YOU.

 LET ME ATART BY INTRODUCING MYSELF PROPERLY TO YOU, I AM MR. JAMES NGOLA, THE FIRST SON OF BRIDGR. GEN.
THEOPHILUS NGOLA (LATE). FORMER CHIEF OF DEFENCE STAFF: NATIONAL REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA. BRIEFLY: MY FATHER, BRIDG. GEN. T. NGOLA BEFORE HIS DEATH DIVERTED THIS FUND (US$25M) TWENTY FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS. MEANT FOR PURCHASE OF AMMUNATION FOR MY COUNTRY "LIBERIA" DURING THE PERIOD OF THEETHNIC CIVIL WAR BETWEEN MY COUNTRY AND GUINEA REPUBLIC. AND NOW, THE WAR IS OVER BY THE INTERVENTION OF "ECOMOG"FORCES. 


FOUR MONTHS AFTER THE WAR ENDED, THE RADIO NATIONAL OF LIBERIA WENT ON AIR, ON A WILD BROADCAST, UNCINGAN UNSUCCESSFUL "COUPD'TAT" IN MY COUNTRY, ATTEPTED TO OVERTROW THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT IN MY COUNTRY HEADED BY "PRESIDENT CHARLES TAYLOR". THIS BROADCAST CONTINUED TO ANNOUNCE THE NAMES OF THOSE IN CONNECTION WITH THE ATTEMPT. BUT UNKNOWINGLY TO ME, MY FATHER WAS INCLUDED AMOUNG THESE GROUP OF MEN ARRESTED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS PLOT AS THE "MASTERMINDER" AND THE "FINANCIER" OF THIS UNDEMOCRATIC ACT. ALTHOUGH HE WAS EXECUTED ALONG SIDE WITH OTHERS. (MAY THEIR SOULS REST IN PERFECT PEACE)

TWO WEEKS AFTER THEIR EXECUTION THE GOVERNMENT OF LIBERIA STIL WENT FURTHER TO PASS JURGEMENT TO CONFISTICATE MY FATHER'S ASSETS AND ALSO TO FREEZE HIS ACCOUNTS. SO WHEN THIS NEWS REACHED ME, I HURRIEDLY GATHERED SOME VALUABLES IN OUR FAMILY VILLA   AND ESCAPED TO (ACCRA), CAPITAL OF GHANA FOR SAFETY, WHILE MY MOTHER AND MY BROTHERS, SISTERS ARE NOW IN COTE D'IVOIRE AS REFUGEES. THIS FILE, WHICH CONTAINING DOCUMENTS OF A CONSIGNMENT (1 METALIC TRUNK BOX) DEPOSITED BY MY LATE FATHER IN ONE OF THE PRIVATE SECURITY COMPANIES, WAS AMOUNG THE VALUBLE THINGS I ESCAPED WITH TO GHANA. HONESTLY SPEAKING, IN THIS"BOX" IS THE SUM OF THIS FUND (US$25 M.) TWENTY FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY
DIVERTED BY MY LATE FATHER. HE REGISTERED THIS CONSIGNMENT (BOX) WITH SECURITY COMPANY AS TO CONTAIN (AFRICA ARTS WORK), BUT THERE IS A CLAUSE IN THE DEPOSIT AGREEMENT WITH THE COMPANY THAT SAYS ONLY HIS FOREIGN PARTNER WILL BE ALLOWED TO COLLECT THE CONSIGNMENT ON HIS BEHALF HENCE HE NEVER WANTED TO BE TRACED WITH THE AMOUNT AS A POPULAR PERSON.




IT IS ON THIS NOTE THAT I AM CONTACTING YOU TO FAITHFULLY AND CONFIDENTIALY ASSIST ME TO "FRONT" AS MY LATE FATHER FOREIGN BUSINESS PARTNER IN ORDER TO NECCESITATE AND FACILITATE THE CLAIM OF THIS CONSIGNMENT FROM THE SECURITY COMPANY. AND THE FUND ALSO BE TRANSFERED
INTO YOUR PRIVATE FOREIGN BANK ACCOUNT FOR INVESTMENT PERHAPS IN YOUR COUNTRY FOR I CANNOT INVEST HERE DUE TO ITS NEARNESS.

ONCE AGAIN, I AM PRESENTLY LIVING IN GHANA ALSO AS A REFUGEE TOO (ASYLUM SEEKER) FOR THE SAKE OF MY LIFE. BE INFORMED, THAT THE FINANCIAL LAW OF GHANA DOES NOT ALLOW A REFUGEE TO OPERATE AN ACCOUNT NOR INCORPORATE A COMPANY. WITH THIS, COUPLED WITH THE WAY IN WHICH THE MONEY WAS ACQUIRED, AND I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO KNOW ABOUT THIS DEVELOPMENT THAT IS WHY I DECIDED NOT TO INVEST IN ANYWHERE IN AFRICA OR LIBERIA NOR EVEN GHANA WHERE I AM CURRENTLY RESIDING AS A REFUGEE AND THAT IS WHY I'M SOLICITING FOR YOUR SUPPORT.




IF YOU AGREE TO ASSIST US, I WILL COMPENSATE YOU WITH 15% OF THE TOTAL FUND AFTER THIS CONSIGNMENT IS CLEARED AND THE MONEY TRANSFERED INTO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT.

MOST IMPORTANT: PROMISE ME TO KEEP THIS TRANSACTION
CONFIDETIAL & SECRET BECAUSE THIS FUND IS THE ONLY HOPE OF 
MY FAMILY.

FINALLY, CONSIDER THIS PROPOSAL AND GET BACK TO ME

Dear Sir, 

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL & URGENT.

I am Mr George Mboro , a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me.

I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars (US$18,500,000.00) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction.

This amount (US$18.5m) represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 30% of the US$18.5 million, 60% for us and 10% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hind!
rance to the successful execution of this transaction.

 I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above tel/fax number ,or my email address:mboro@accountant.com whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me contact other another Foreign partner with recommendation to carry out this deal. I want to assure you that myself and my partners are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and Please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter; because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business. 

I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. I am available to entertain any questions concerning the clarity of this transaction.

 Yours faithfully,

Mr  George  Mboro

I am pleased to get across to you for a very urgent and profitable Business proposal, though I don't know you neither have I seen you before but my confidence was reposed on you when the Chief Executive of Lagos State chamber of Commerce and Industry handed me your contact for a confidential business. I am a Staff of United Bank
for Africa (UBA),Ilupeju branch, Lagos Nigeria.

The intended business is thus; we had a customer, a Foreigner (a Turkish) resident in Nigeria, he was a Contractor with one of the Government Parastatals. He has in his Account in my branch the sum of US$21.5 Million (Twenty One Million Five Hundred ThousandU.S.Dollars).Unfortunately, the man died four years ago until today non-of his next of kin has come forward to claim the money. Having noticed this, I in collaboration with two other top Officials of the bank we have covered up the account all this while. Now we want you (being a foreigner) to be fronted as one of his next of kin and forward your account and other relevant documents to be advised to you by us to attest to the Claim. We will use our positions to get all internal documentations to back up the claims .The whole procedures will last only ten working days to get the Fund retrieved successfully Without trace even in future.

Your response is only what we are waiting for as we have arranged all necessary things. As soon as this message comes to you kindly get back to me indicating your interest ,Then I will furnish you with the whole procedures to ensure that the deal is successfully Concluded. 

For your assistance we have agreed to give you thirty percent (30%) of the Total sum at the end of the transaction. It is risk free and a mega fortune. All correspondence towards this transaction will be through the e-mail addresses, Telephone and Fax, until the end of the
transaction when we will meet for the sharing of the money based on this agreed percentage.

Please reply urgently by e-mail, fax or call me on my private telephone numbers as stated above.

I await your earliest response.

Thanks, 

Yours Sincerely

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL 
RE: TRANSFER OF US$21.5 MILLION (TWENTY ONE MILLION, 
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS ONLY). 

I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry 
as we are using the only secured and confidential medium available to 
seek for foreign assistance/partnership in a business transaction 
which is of mutual benefit. 

I am a member of the Federal Government of Nigeria Contract Award and 
Monitoring Committee in the Nigeria National Petroleum 
Corporatio(NNPC). Sometime ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign 
firm in NNPC by my Committee. This contract was over invoiced to the 
tune of US$21.5M. U.S. Dollars. This was done deliberately. The 
over-invoicing was a deal by my committee to benefit from the 
project. We now want to transfer this money which is in a suspense 
Account with NNPC into any Overseas Account which we expect you to 
provide for us. 

SHARE: - 
For providing the account where we shall remit the money into, you 
will be entitled to 30% of the money,60% will be for me andmy 
partners while 10% has been mapped out from the total sum to cover 
any expenses that maybe incurred by us during the course of this 
transfer,both locally and international expenses. 
I would require the following: - 

. Your company's name,address,telephone and fax numbers. 
The above information would be used to make formal applications as a 
matter of procedure for the release of the money and onward transfer 
to your account. 
It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects 
of this nature described here. The assumption is that your company 
won the major contract and subcontracted it out to other companies. 
More often than not,big trading companies or firms of unrelated 
fields win major contracts and subcontracts to more specialized firms 
for execution of such contracts. 

We have strong reliable connections and contacts at the Central Bank 
of Nigeria, as well as the Federal Ministry of Finance and we have no 
doubt that all the money will be released and transferred if we get 
the necessary foreign partner to assist us in this deal. 
Therefore,when the business is successfully concluded we shall 
through our same connections withdraw all documents used from all the 
concerned Government Ministries for 100% security. 

We are ordinary civil servants and we will not want to miss this once 
in a lifetime opportunity to get rich. We want this money to be 
transferred to the overseas Accounts for us, before the present 
Democratic Government start Auditing all Federal Government owned 
Parastatals. 

Please contact me immediately through my telephone number whether or 
not you are interested in this deal.If you are not,it will enable me 
scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal. Butwhere 
you are interested,send the required documents aforementioned herein 
through my above telephone number,or 
email:edema_ma@mauimail.com,because time is of the essence in this 
business. 
I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. 

Yours faithfully, 
Edema Martins.

 From;Mr.Michael Kamah and Family,
          Johannesburg,South Africa.

My Dear ,

Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.

My name is Mr.Michael Kamah, the second son of Mr.Smith  Kamah, of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block an!
d confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.

During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Seven Million and Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$7.400.000.00],in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugab!
e's regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.

Now this is what I actually want you to do for me;

1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.
2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. 

Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.

Best Regards, 

Mr.Michael Kamah and family.

DEAR FRIEND, 

I AM MRS.  SESE-SEKO WIDOW OF LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU 
SESE-SEKO OF ZAIRE? NOW KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC 
OF CONGO (DRC).  I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER, 
THIS WAS IN CONFIDENCE  CONSIDERING MY PRESENT 
CIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION. 

I ESCAPED ALONG WITH MY HUSBAND AND TWO OF OUR SONS

CONGO (DRC) TO ABIDJAN, COTE D'IVOIRE WHERE MY FAMILY 
AND I SETTLED, WHILE WE LATER MOVED  TO SETTLED IN 
MORROCO WHERE MY HUSBAND LATER DIED OF CANCER 
DISEASE. HOWEVER DUE TO THIS SITUATION WE DECIDED TO 
CHANGED  MOST OF MY HUSBAND'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
DEPOSITED IN SWISS BANK AND OTHER COUNTRIES INTO OTHER 

FORMS OF MONEY CODED FOR  SAFE PURPOSE BECAUSE THE NEW 

HEAD OF STATE OF (DR) MR LAURENT  KABILA HAS MADE 
ARRANGEMENT WITH THE SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER 
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE ALL MY LATE HUSBAND'S 
TREASURES  DEPOSITED IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. HENCE 

MY CHILDREN AND I DECIDED LAYING LOW IN AFRICA TO 
STUDY THE SITUATION TILL  WHEN THINGS GETS BETTER, 
LIKE NOW THAT PRESIDENT KABILA IS DEAD AND THE SON 
TAKING OVER (JOSEPH KABILA). ONE OF MY LATE HUSBAND'S 
CHATEAUX IN SOUTHERN FRANCE WAS CONFISCATED  BY THE 
FRENCH GOVERNMENT, AND AS SUCH I HAD TO CHANGE MY 
IDENTITY  SO THAT MY INVESTMENT WILL NOT BE TRACED AND 

CONFISCATED. I HAVE DEPOSITED THE SUM OF EIHGTEEN 
MLLION UNITED STATE DOLLARS(US$18,000,000,00.)  WITH A 


SECURITY COMPANY , FOR SAFEKEEPING. THE  FUNDS ARE 
SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM KNOWING THE 
CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO INDICATE YOUR 
INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST US BY RECEIVING THE 
MONEY ON OUR BEHALF.ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE, SO THAT 
I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO MY SON (KONGOLO) WHO HAS THE 
OUT MODALITIES FOR THE CLAIM OF THE SAID FUNDS. I WANT 

YOU TO ASSIST IN INVESTING THIS MONEY, BUT I WILL NOT 
WANT MY IDENTITY REVEALED. I WILL ALSO WANT TO BUY 
PROPERTIES AND STOCK IN MULTI-NATIONAL COMPANIES AND 
TO ENGAGE IN OTHER SAFE AND NON-SPECULATIVE 
INVESTMENTS. MAY I AT THIS POINT EMPHASISE THE HIGH 
LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY,  WHICH THIS BUSINESS 
DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY THE TRUST AND 
CONFIDENCE, WHICH I REPOSE IN YOU. IN CONCLUSION,  IF 
YOU WANT TO ASSIST US , MY SON SHALL PUT YOU IN THE 
PICTURE  OF THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU WHERE THE FUNDS ARE 

CURRENTLY BEING  MAINTAINED AND ALSO DISCUSS OTHER 
MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATION FOR YOUR SERVICES. 

FOR THIS REASON KINDLY FURNISH US YOUR CONTACT 
INFORMATION, THAT IS YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND FAX 
NUMBER FOR CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSE AND ACKNOWLEDGE 
RECEIPT OF THIS MAIL USING THE ABOVE EMAIL ADDRESS.

payment should be effected to you by the Ministry, The 
contract sum of which shall run into US$27.4 Million,

some estates abroad. For this too you shall also serve as our agent. 
 
In the light of this, I would like you to forward to

 BUSINESS PROPOSAL

Dear sir / Madam 


My name is DR, ADAMS OBOZUWA., a member of the Presidential 
Task Force on Oil Spillage Clean-up. Early last year there 
was a major oil spillage in the Niger Delta Region of 
Nigeria which rendered over 70% of the communities 
homeless.The contract was handled by a foreign firm but 
because of the huge monetary profit we envisaged we decided 
to over-invoice the contract sum. Now the contract has been 
completed and the original contractor has since been 
paid,but the contract balance of US$38 million,which 
resulted from the over invoiced contract sum that has been 
left in a suspense account with the DEBT RECONCILIATION 
COMMITTEE A SUBSIDIARY OF THE APEX BANK,is what me and my 
partners are planning to take out of the country for 
ourselves.The problem is as government officials,we are not 
suppose to own fat bank accounts,talk less of having 
foreign ones.To this end, we are soliciting your assistance 
as a foreign partner who can assist us and receive this 
amount into your account. We are ready to share this money 
with you on the basis of participation. We also have plans 
to invest part of this money in any viable business in your 
country under your care,as we are nearing our retirement 
age. In any case, I received a reference of 
you/organization from the Nigeria Chambers of Commerce and 
Industry =91Foreign Trade Division=92 as a reputable organ that 
can assist us on this transaction. Please if you accept my 
proposal do not hesitate to send me a fax on 234 1 759 0379 
or send me an e-mail on: 
adamuohiroma, so that I can provide you with the basic 
procedures for the release of the fund. It does not matter 
whether you or your company does contract project of the 
nature described here, the assumption is that you won a 
major contract and subcontracted it to another company, 
more often than not, big trading companies or individuals 
of unrelated field win major contracts here in Nigeria and 
subcontracts same to more specialized firms for execution. 
BENEFIT For providing the account where we shall remit this 
money, you will be entitled to 25% of the entire funds, 70% 
will be for me and my partners,while 5% has been set aside 
to cover any expenses that may be incurred by both parties 
during this transaction, both local and international. 
Please I enjoin you to handle this transaction with utmost 
degree of maturity and confidentiality because I am still 
in active government service with the =93NIGERIAN NATIONAL 
PETROLEUM CORPORATION=94. If I receive your response on time, 
this whole transaction could be accomplished within the 
shortest possible time based on your interest and 
determination,since the money is already in transit. 
Please, try to call me up to confirm the receipt of your 
fax or e-mail.The lines may be busy,but keep trying till 
you get through. 

Yours faithfully, 

DR, ADAMS OBOZUWA. (MNIM)

TRANSFER OF USD$22MILLION INTO YOUR ACCOUNT}

ATTENTION: President\CEO.

I, on behalf of my other colleagues from different
organs of Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) owned
parastatals decided to solicit your assistance as
regards transfer of the above-mentioned amount into
your bank account.  This fund accrued from over
invoicing of various contract awarded in my parastatal
to certain Foreign Contractors sometimes ago.

We, as holders of sensitive position in our various
parastatals, were mandated by the Federal Government
to Scrutinise all payments made to certain foreign
Contractors and we discovered that some of the
contracts they executed were grossly over-invoiced
either by omission or commission.  In the process the
sum of US$27M (Twenty Seven Million US Dollars only)
was found lying in the parastatal suspense account
after the foreign contractors had been paid their
rightful dues for executing the said contracts.

We all agreed that this over-invoiced amount be
transferred (for our own use) into a bank account
provided by a foreign partner, because we are
government workers and the Code of Conduct does not
allow us to operate foreign accounts.

However, we have succeeded in transferring some of
this money precisely US$5.0M (Five Million US Dollars
only) into a foreign account in MOROCCO (North
Africa), but the provider of the account in MOROCCO is
up to some mischief and refuses to comply to the
earlier mutual agreement by insisting that the total
amount be paid into his nominated bank account before
disbursement will take effect.  If for a meagre sum of
US$5.0M (Five Million US Dollars only) we are not
compensated, is it when the balance of US$22M
(Twenty-two Million US Dollars)is transferred that we
will be sure of our full compensation? Of course, this
abuse of trust and inhumanity calls for sober
reflection and search for absolute trust.

Thus we are seeking your unwavering assistance that
the remaining amount of US$22M can be speedily
processed and fully remitted into your nominated bank
account.  On successful remittance of the fund into
your account, you will be compensated with 30% of the
amount for your assistance and services.

So far, much have been said and due to our sensitive
positions, we cannot afford a slip in this transaction
neither can we give out identity as regards our
respective offices, but whereby cordial relationship
is established, smooth operations commences, you will
be furnished with details of all you deserves to know.

I am at your disposition to entertain any question
from you with respect to this transaction, so contact
me immediately through my e:mail for further
information on the requirements and procedure for this
transaction.

Please, treat with the strictest confidentiality and
utmost urgency.

Yours faithfully,

MR FRED OBI.

Dear sir,
 
I am Dr.Mbeki Ngumeni, a native of Cape town in South
Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South
Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources.
First and foremost, I apologize for using this medium to
reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council(SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described Hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction.
 
Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an
Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty-one Million, Five Hundred Thousand US.Dollars ($21,500,000.) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction.
 
This amount $21.5m represents the balance of the total
contract value executed on behalf of my Department by
a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials
over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract
cost have been paid to the original contractor,
leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount
which we have in principles gotten approval to remit
by Key tested Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any
foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an
application through the Ministry of Justice here in
South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges
of the former contractor to you. I have the authority
of my partners involved to propose that should you be
willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of
the sum will be 25% of the $21.5 million, 70% for us
and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The
business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided
you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality.
Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to
the successful execution of this transaction. I have
reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will
not disappoint me.
 
Endeavor to contact me immediately through my e- mail
to confirm whether or not you
are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will
enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry
out this deal.
 
 
I want to assure you that my partners and myself are
in a position to make the payment of this claim
possible provided you can give us a very strong
Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured
and please, remember to treat this matter very
confidential , because we will not comprehend with any
form of exposure as we are still in active Government
Service .Once again, remember that time is of great
essence in this transaction. I wait in anticipation of
your fullest co-operation.
You can contact me through this e-mail address:- mbengu@37.com
Lastly,please try to send me your telephone and fax number so     that we candiscuss in details.
 
Yours faithfully,
Dr.Mbeki Ngumeni.

Dear Sir,

Let me first apologise to you for any mbarrassment
this mail might cause you.
I am MAHOYI BELLO, a cousin to the Vice Presidentof
the Federal Republic of Nigeria (Alhaji Atiku) and
Executive Director of SADIQ PETROLUEM LTD.I have
decided to contact you for this business proposal
based on the mutual understanding I know that can
exist between us, having known that people of your
Country are trustworthy.

Since May 1999 when the new Government came to
power,large sums of money have been recovered from our
past military leaders who siphoned money from Nigeria
and deposited it in offshore accounts in
Europe,America,Asia and some parts of Africa, for
their own selfish benefits. This happened during the
military regime,Now we are under a democratically
elected government. This fund was among the money
recovered and seized by the Federal Government of
Nigeria. 

Hence, my elder cousin (Alhaji Atiku Abubakar) the
Vice-President of Nigeria is in charge of all
off-shore accounts seized and retrieved from our past
military leaders.Therefore, we urged you to assist us
provide a very vital offshore account, where the sum
of US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty Five Million) US Dollars
will be transferred for safe keeping. 

Presently, this money is in a foreign Country I cannot
mention now.Please note that other information will be
detailed to you on the receipt of your reply. My
elder cousin and I have agreed to give you (the
account owner)for this transaction 30% of the total
amount remitted while 60%is for me and Cousin Atiku,
for the purchase of foreign investments, with your
assistance after the money have been disbursed, while
10% is for expenses both of us will incur.

Note, I have been mandated by my elder cousin to
handle this deal with you, due to his position in the
Nigerian Government as the second citizen. Therefore,
if my proposal satisfies you, kindly contact me via my
e-mail address and enclose your phone and fax numbers
for urgent confidential discussion.Your letter of
acceptance indicating your personal telephone and fax
numbers to enable us move ahead.

Besides, this transaction is risk-free and hoped to
last 7 (seven) banking days upon my elder cousin
Alhaji Atiku Abubakar's authorisation.I thank you for
your expected co-operation. 

God Bless you.Best Regards.

MAHOYI BELLO.

ATTN:MANAGING DIRECTOR

I am writing this proposal hoping that you would be of assistance in this business of mutual benefit. My name is Mr.David Agu an auditor at one of the Federal Ministries in lagos-Nigeria. 

During our last audit exercise,some amount of money totalling $16.5Million was discovered and traced to be owned by one late Engineer Muller Robert, a foreigner who died in a plane crash. The source of this fund was further traced to be a contract payment made to him but has remained unclaimed till now.Since his death, nobody has shown up to claim this fund and this attracted my curiosity. 

I therefore made a research and found out that he did not leave any next of kin in his confidential document with the ministry that he executed the contract for. A panel setup by the Federal Government on recovery of funds expects that this fund should be unquestionably claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or alternatively the fund should be donated for arms and ammunition at a military war college here in Nigeria. Fervent valuable efforts were made by the Panel to get in touch with any of the family or relatives but all have proved to no avail.

It is because of the perceived possibility of not going to be able to locate any next of kin ( he had no wife and children) that the panel under the influence of our chairman, Rtd Major General Usman Bello, that arrangement is being made for the fund to be declared UNCLAIMABLED and then be donated to the Trust Fund for arms and ammunition which will further enhance the perpetration of war in Africa and the third world in general. To forestall this move, my colleagues and I have taken it upon ourselves to source for a foreign partner who could assist in claimimg this fund for further transfer abroad. 

I have been given the sole mandate to source for a partner as soon as possible to that effect.All documents and proof to enable you get this fund have been carefully worked out and I am assuring you a 100% risk free involvement. Your share would be 30% of the total amount if you agree to assist while 10% would be set aside to offset all expenses in course of the transfer and the rest would be for us for investment purposes in your country. 

If this proposal is OK by you, and you do wish to take the advantage of the trust we hope to bestow on you and your company, then kindly reach me immediately via Fax:234-1-7597019 furnishing me with your most confidential telephone and fax numbers and exclusive email so that I can forward to you the relevant details of the transaction. I expect your urgent response. 

Regards,
David.

Dear Friend,


 My name is DR,IDRIS BELLO, a member of the Presidential 
Task Force on Oil Spillage Clean-up.
 Early last year there was a major oil spillage in 
the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria which rendered over 70% 
of the communities homeless.
 A contract was awarded to a foreign firm to 
rehabilitate the communitties, because of the huge monetary 
profit I envisaged, we decided to over-invoice the contract 
sum.

 Now the contract has been completed and the original 
contractor has long been paid,but the contract
 balance of THIRTY EIGHT MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS
(US$38 MILLION),which resulted from the over invoiced
 contract sum has been left in a suspense account with the 
DEBT RECONCILIATION COMMITTEE,A SUBSIDIARY OF OUR APEX BANK,
 This over invoice sum is what we intend to take out of 
the country for ourselves.

The problem is as government officials,we are not suppose 
to own fat bank accounts,talk less of having foreign ones.
 To this end, we are soliciting your assistance as a 
foreign partner who can assist us and receive this amount 
into your account.

 We are ready to share this money with you on the basis 
of participation.
we also have plans to invest part of this money in any 
viable business in your country under your care,as we are 
nearing our retirement age.

Dear Friend,


 My name is DR,IDRIS BELLO, a member of the Presidential 
Task Force on Oil Spillage Clean-up.
 Early last year there was a major oil spillage in 
the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria which rendered over 70% 
of the communities homeless.
 A contract was awarded to a foreign firm to 
rehabilitate the communitties, because of the huge monetary 
profit I envisaged, we decided to over-invoice the contract 
sum.

 Now the contract has been completed and the original 
contractor has long been paid,but the contract
 balance of THIRTY EIGHT MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS
(US$38 MILLION),which resulted from the over invoiced
 contract sum has been left in a suspense account with the 
DEBT RECONCILIATION COMMITTEE,A SUBSIDIARY OF OUR APEX BANK,
 This over invoice sum is what we intend to take out of 
the country for ourselves.

The problem is as government officials,we are not suppose 
to own fat bank accounts,talk less of having foreign ones.
 To this end, we are soliciting your assistance as a 
foreign partner who can assist us and receive this amount 
into your account.

 We are ready to share this money with you on the basis 
of participation.
we also have plans to invest part of this money in any 
viable business in your country under your care,as we are 
nearing our retirement age.

 In any case, I received a reference of you/organization 
from the Nigeria Chambers of Commerce and Industry =91Foreign 
Trade Division=92as a reputable organ that can assist us on 
this transaction.

 Please if you accept my proposal do not hesitate to reply 
to me on my e-mail:(bello_dd@doctor.com)or
(obilolo@netscape.net) so that I can provide you with the 
basic procedures for the release of the fund. 

 It does not matter whether you or your company does 
contract project of the nature described here, the 
assumption is that you won a major contract and 
subcontracted it to another company, more often than
not, big trading companies or individuals of unrelated 
field win major contracts here in Nigeria and subcontracts 
same to more specialized 
firms for execution.

 The BENEFIT For providing the account where we shall remit 
this money, you will be entitled to 25% of the entire 
funds, 70% will be for me and my partners,while 5% has been 
set aside to cover any expenses that
may be incurred by both parties during this transaction, 
both local and international.

 Please I enjoin you to handle this transaction with utmost 
degree of maturity and confidentiality because 

I am still in active government service with the NIGERIAN 
NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION.

If I receive your response on time, this whole transaction 
could be accomplished within the shortest possible time 
based on your interest and determination,since the money is 
already on transit.

 Please, try to call me up to confirm the receipt of this e-
mail on my confidential TEL/FAX: 234 1 759 0379.
 The lines may be busy,but keep trying till you get 
through. 

Yours faithfully, 

DR,IDRIS BELLO..

REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS TRANSACTION. 
Dear Sir,
I am Dr.John Ejime,the financial controller of the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation Headquarters Lagos. I am writing you on behalf of my colleagues
in the corporation and have been assign to seek for the assistance of a
reliable foreign company through which we can transfer the sum of Thirty
Five Million United States Dollars Only (US$35,000,000). This fund is deposited
in the Corporation Treasury account with the Apex Bank. 
ORIGIN OF THE FUND: 
This sum arose from the deliberated over-invoicing of a contract awarded
by my ministry Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to foreign firm in
the twinlight days of the last military regime. This contract has been completely
executed and commissioned and the contractor that handled this contract
has collected his full and final payment thus leaving behind the above stated
amount which represent the over invoiced sum. We have been safeguarding
this money for conducive time for it's transfer out of the country for our
personal use. However, the code of employment does not allow us (civil servant)
to own and operate foreign account and because the contract was handled
by a foreign firm and the payment made in dollars, we now need a foreign
partner that will present himself as the sub-contractor so that the fund
will be transfer into your company's or personal account. Your address was
made available to us by a very good friend who work with the Nigeria export
promotion council and he assured us of your company's viability and capability
in business transaction. This assurance gave us the courage to link you
up in this particular transaction and I hope it will be of mutual benefit
to all of us. Note that the nature of your business is not particularly
relevant to the success of the transaction. All we require is your willingness
to present yourself as the subcontractor by providing your bank information
so that the fund will be transferred into your account. 
SHARING RATIO:
 For your assistance in this business , your share will be 30% of the total
fund. I and my colleagues will take 60% while we set aside 10% for any expenses
that may incurred in the course of this transaction. If you are willing
to assist us in this business. Send the following information. 
1. Name of your bank and address 
2. Your account number/beneficiary�s name. 
3. Your private telephone and fax number for easy communication. 
This information will enable us put an application for payment approval
to the concerned Ministries and final to the Senate Committee on Contract
Payment and it is going to last for fourteen working days starting from
the day we receive the above information. All modalities for the take off
of this transaction have been worked out and further action will commence
immediately we hear from you. I am waiting for your reply by fax on this
fax number :234-1-7592865 as stated above. 
Yours faithfully. 
Dr.John Ejime.
